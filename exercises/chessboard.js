/* Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height. */

var size = 8; //this is the variable setting
var board = "";//this is the empty string we're going to add either ' ' , '#' or newline

for (var y = 0; y < size; y++) {   /*in the outer loop we add newline to seperate rows*/
  for (var x = 0; x < size; x++) {/*every inner loop rappresents a line, and alternatively it's adding either ' ' or '#' to the string that's being populated*/
    if ((x + y) % 2 == 0)
      board += " ";
    else
      board += "#";
  }
  board += "\n";
}

console.log(board);
